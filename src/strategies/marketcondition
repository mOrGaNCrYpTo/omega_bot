# This is a very basic implementation and the thresholds and rules are quite arbitrary. You would need to adjust 
# them based on your specific needs and observations of the market.

# Once you have defined the market conditions, you can then use this information to switch between different 
# strategies or adjust the parameters of your strategy. For example, you might use a more aggressive strategy in a
# bull market and a more conservative strategy in a bear market. Or you might adjust the stop loss and take profit 
# levels based on the volatility of the market
